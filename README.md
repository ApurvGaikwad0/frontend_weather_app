## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project from GitHub:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ApurvGaikwad0/frontend_weather_app.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd frontend_weather_app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies using `pnpm`:
```sh
pnpm install
```

If you prefer `npm`, use:
```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your OpenWeatherMap API key:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### 4. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the development server:
```sh
pnpm dev
```

If using `npm`, run:
```sh
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied for Geolocation**: Ensure your browser has permission to access your location.
